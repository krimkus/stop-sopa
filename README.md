# STOP SOPA

This repository is my take on "going dark" for the [January 18 blackout to protest SOPA](http://sopastrike.com/).

You can use the provided **`index.html`** as your site's homepage on January 18 as one possible way to participate.

[**It looks like this.**](http://www.zachstronaut.com/lab/text-shadow-box/stop-sopa.html)

Alternately, you can use the provided **`sopa.js`** to append the code to an existing page. The current site will be vaguely visible through the background. As a quick hack, the append will only happen if the user's date is set to the 18th. That way, the protest will automatically end without having to change code.

I felt inspired by the "going dark" theme.  I've been calling my representatives in Congress, but this gave me another outlet for my frustration with this legislation.  I place this code in the public domain.  I require no attribution.
